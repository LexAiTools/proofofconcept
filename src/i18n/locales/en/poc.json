Interactive App PoC (€488) is a full-featured application with lead collection system that works like a real app and is ready in 3 days. Choose Quick Start if you just want to show the concept, and Interactive App if you need a working product to collect your first customers."

        "question": "How much does each PoC package cost and what's included in the price?",
        "answer": "1) Quick Start PoC - €349 ($380, 24h): clickable React app ready for presentation. 2) Interactive App PoC - €488 ($532, 3 days): working app with lead system. 3) Complete Package - €651 ($710, 7 days): explainer video + landing page + sales content. 4) Custom Project - individually priced. 5) Professional Website with AI - €3,814 ($4,160, 14 days): full website with 24/7 AI assistant.

      },
      {
        "question": "How long does each package take to complete?",
        "answer": "Quick Start PoC - 24 hours, Interactive App PoC - 3 days, Complete Package - 7 days, Professional Website with AI - 14 days. Custom Project depends on scope. Implementation starts immediately after filling out the form and payment. Upon completion, you receive access to the admin panel where you can manage your project."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the Complete PoC Package include?",
        "answer": "The Complete Package (€651 / $710, 7 days) is a comprehensive product presentation solution containing: 1) Professional explainer video presenting your product, 2) Landing page with lead collection system, 3) Ready-made sales content tailored to your industry.

      },
      {
        "question": "What technologies are used to create PoC prototypes?",
        "answer": "All our PoC prototypes are created in React - the modern and most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We also use TypeScript for code safety, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and Vite for fast development. For packages with backend, we use Supabase (database, authentication, storage). Thanks to these technologies, your prototype can be easily expanded into a full production application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I receive the source code of my application or prototype?",
        "answer": "Yes, you get full access to your prototype's source code through the admin panel (admin.corballyconcepts.com). You can download the code, modify it, expand it, or hand it over to your developer team. The code is written clearly using best practices, making further development easier. Additionally, if you choose to expand to a full application, we can continue working on the same codebase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I test the prototype before final acceptance?",
        "answer": "Of course! After creating the prototype, you receive a link to the working version that you can test on any device (computer, tablet, phone). You can show the prototype to potential customers, your team, or investors and gather feedback. If something needs improvement, we can make modifications. Our goal is to deliver a prototype that 100% meets your expectations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the PoC package ordering and implementation process look like?",
        "answer": "The process is simple: 1) Choose the right package and click 'Order', 2) Fill out the form describing your idea (the more details, the better), 3) Pay for the package, 4) We start work immediately, 5) You receive regular progress updates, 6) Upon completion, you get access to the admin panel with your prototype, 7) You can test and report feedback. The entire process is transparent and fast."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the 'Pay and Have' model mean?",
        "answer": "The 'Pay and Have' model means you pay a fixed price upfront and immediately receive a working prototype - no hidden costs, no surprises, no additional fees. There are no hourly billings or negotiations. You know exactly how much you'll pay and what you'll get. It's a simple, transparent, and effective approach that eliminates the risk of budget overruns. Pay once, have the product."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I order a custom package tailored to my needs?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! If standard packages don't meet your needs, we offer Custom Tailored PoC Projects. Every idea is different - some projects require unusual functionalities, integrations with external systems, specific design, or longer implementation time. Contact us through the form or email, describe your requirements, and we'll develop a custom offer tailored exactly to your project and budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I continue developing and modifying the prototype after delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes! You have full control over the code and can freely modify it. You receive access to the admin panel and code repository. You can: 1) Make changes yourself if you have a developer team, 2) Commission us for further development - we offer prototype expansion services to full applications, 3) Hand over the code to another company - you own all the code. The prototype is yours and you can do whatever you want with it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it possible to expand the PoC into a full production application?",
        "answer": "Yes, this is one of the main goals of our PoC prototypes! All prototypes are created with expansion in mind. We use professional technologies (React, TypeScript, Supabase) that allow for scaling. After validating the idea on the prototype, we can expand it with: full backend, advanced functionalities, payment integrations, user system, mobile apps, and much more. It's much faster and cheaper than building from scratch."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer technical support after project delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer technical support. After prototype delivery: 1) You receive documentation and usage instructions, 2) You have access to the admin panel where you can manage the project, 3) In case of technical problems, you can contact us via email or contact form, 4) We offer paid support packages if you need regular assistance, 5) We can also train your team in system operation. Our goal is to ensure you succeed with our product."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who are the PoC packages for? Who can use them?",
        "answer": "PoC packages are ideal for: 1) Startups that need an MVP for investor presentations without spending tens of thousands on full development, 2) Entrepreneurs testing new business ideas before major investment, 3) Companies that want to quickly verify new functionality or product, 4) Innovators needing a quick prototype for presentations at competitions or pitches, 5) Anyone who has an idea for an app or website and wants to see how it will look in practice - without technical knowledge or programming skills."
